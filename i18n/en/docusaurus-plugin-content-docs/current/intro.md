**About the Institution**

**Y.U.X.U.A.N. Research Center**

The Y.U.X.U.A.N. Research Center (Yonder Union for eXploration, Understanding, and Nullification of Anomalies) was established in 1985, initially named "Distant Anomaly Research Group". At that time, a series of unexplainable supernatural phenomena appeared globally, capturing the attention of the scientific community and governments.

**Founder**:
The institution was co-founded by renowned physicist Zhang Peng and historian Ma██. The duo stumbled upon an anomalous object during an archaeological expedition, realizing that a bigger secret awaited disclosure. They assembled a team of experts from various fields to establish this research group, aiming to investigate, study, and address these anomalies.

**Development History**:
Initially, the group comprised fewer than ██ members. However, as more and more anomalous phenomena and objects were discovered, the group grew steadily, attracting additional funding and talent. In 1995, it was officially renamed the Y.U.X.U.A.N. Research Center, receiving formal approval and funding from the government.

**Institutional Objectives**:
1. **Exploration**: Identify and document all known and unknown anomalous phenomena and objects.
2. **Understanding**: Attempt to explain the origins and mechanisms of these anomalies through scientific research.
3. **Nullification**: Isolate or eliminate anomalies that may pose threats to humanity.

**Main Facilities**:
Y.U.X.U.A.N. has multiple research laboratories and bases worldwide, with the largest being the headquarters located in China██. Additionally, there are branches in the United States, Europe, and Africa.

**Subordinate Departments**:
1. **Anomaly Exploration Department**: Responsible for globally locating and documenting anomalies.
2. **Scientific Research Department**: Composed of experts in various fields, responsible for in-depth research of collected anomalies.
3. **Safety and Protection Department**: Responsible for isolating and controlling potentially dangerous anomalies.

**Relationship with Other Organizations**:
Y.U.X.U.A.N. collaborates with numerous global research institutions and government departments to jointly research and address anomalous phenomena. Simultaneously, there have been instances of information exchange and collaboration with other organizations familiar with anomalies.

**Future Outlook**:
With advancements in technology and a deeper understanding of anomalies, Y.U.X.U.A.N. hopes to discover more ways to harness these anomalies for the benefit of humanity, rather than merely controlling and isolating them.
