# YUC-001 - Sima Guang

**Project Number**: YUC-001

**Project Level**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**:
---

**Containment Location**: 
YUC-001 should be securely contained in the B sector of Y.U.X.U.A.N. research center's ██ research facility.

**Room Specifications**: 
- Dimensions: 5 meters x 5 meters, height 3 meters.
- The room should have walls at least 20 cm thick for soundproofing.
- Internal temperature should be maintained at 21°C, with a relative humidity of 50%.
- The room should be equipped with surveillance cameras to ensure 24-hour uninterrupted monitoring.
- Entrance consists of a dual secure door system to ensure YUC-001 cannot pass through both doors simultaneously.

**Room Equipment**: 
- A standard single bed, desk, and chair.
- A mirror-less restroom including a toilet, washbasin, and shower.
- A bookshelf for YUC-001, filled with books and magazines not related to BDSM for reading.
- A radio device, but it can only tune into preset channels.
- All furniture should be fixed to the floor or wall to prevent YUC-001 from using it for self-binding.

**Security Measures**: 
- No ropes, belts, chains, or other items potentially used for self-binding or asphyxiation should be placed inside YUC-001's room.
- Staff interacting with YUC-001 should undergo specialized training, including recognizing BDSM behaviors, methods to counteract the energy field produced by YUC-001, and emergency response measures.
- During interactions with YUC-001, a distance should always be maintained, and at least two staff members should be present in the room. Special permission is required for one-on-one interactions in exceptional cases.
- YUC-001's behavior should be monitored daily. Any abnormal behaviors or psychological changes should be reported immediately.
- YUC-001 should undergo psychological evaluation at least once a month. This evaluation should be conducted by a senior psychologist and recorded in his file.

**Description**:
---

YUC-001, also known as Sima Guang, is an entity that shares the name but is entirely different from the historical figure from China. He is a middle-aged Asian male, approximately 1.75 meters tall, and weighing around 70 kilograms. YUC-001 claims to have no connection with the historical Sima Guang.

YUC-001's main characteristic is his extreme obsession with BDSM. Unlike ordinary people, when YUC-001 engages in BDSM activities, he can produce an unknown energy field. This energy field can induce others within a certain range to exhibit interest and behavior patterns similar to YUC-001. The effects of this energy field are temporary, but individuals affected typically do not remember their actions during the period of influence.

In addition, YUC-001 also demonstrates a high mastery of traditional binding techniques, especially those related to ancient China. He claims this is a memory from his "past life", but there's no evidence to support this claim yet.

**Appendix**:
---

YUC-001 was discovered by the Y.U.X.U.A.N. research center in 20XX when he was performing a BDSM show in an underground club. Several audience members suddenly displayed behavior patterns similar to YUC-001 during his performance, drawing the center's attention.

After containment, YUC-001 cooperated fully with the center's staff, but he has repeatedly requested BDSM-related items, which have been denied.
